load control file (original csv) into array (of objects?)

load exported csv into array (of objects?)

foreach line in control file
    search exported csv for a match
    when we find one, remove from exported array, and add to a new array of objects (i.e. the new order), this could just be spotify ids
    if we don't find one, prompt to check the exported csv file and ask the user to enter the ID, can then be removed

we should then have a list of spotify ids that we can make a call to the api to ‚ù§
